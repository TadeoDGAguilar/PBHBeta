The `PBHBeta` library is a computational tool designed to calculate constraints on the abundance of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and the power spectrum (PS) in cosmological scenarios featuring a non-standard evolution phase between the end of inflation and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). 

```{warning}
This project is under development.
```

```{note}
This code has been tested exclusively with Python version 3.9, and we strongly recommend using it with versions higher than this (Python 3.x and above).
```

The GitHub repository and PyPI package for `PBHBeta` include the essential libraries necessary to run `PBHBeta`. However, these dependencies must be imported into the notebook or console for the functions to become accesible. Refer to the [requeriments](../Requeriments.md) and [installation](../Installation.md) sections.
